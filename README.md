## Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml)

<!-- start usage -->
```yaml
- uses: brenoepics/vmd-action@v0.0.6
  with:
    # Personal access token (PAT) used to fetch the repository. The PAT is
    # configured with the local git config, which enables your scripts to run
    # authenticated git commands. The post-job step removes the PAT.
    #
    # We recommend using a service account with the least permissions necessary.
    # Also when generating a new PAT, select the least scopes necessary.

    # Version of Vue Mess Detector to use. This can be a specific version number
    # or 'latest' to use the most recent version available.
    version: ''

    # If set to 'true', the action will skip the installation of Vue Mess Detector.
    # This can be useful if Vue Mess Detector is already installed in your environment.
    skipInstall: ''

    # If set to 'true', the action will skip running analysis on pull requests
    # created by bots. This can help reduce unnecessary analysis runs.
    skipBots: ''

    # If set to 'true', the action will post comments on pull requests with the
    # results of the analysis. If set to 'false', no comments will be posted.
    commentsEnabled: ''

    # The package manager to use for installing dependencies. Supported values
    # are 'npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm', and 'bun'. If not specified, the action will
    # attempt to detect the package manager based on the lock file present in
    # the repository.
    packageManager: ''

    # Additional arguments to pass to Vue Mess Detector when running the analysis.
    # This can be used to customize the behavior of the analysis.

    # analysis will start. If not specified, the current directory will be used.
    entryPoint: ''

    # The source directory to analyze. This should be the path to the directory
    # containing the source code you want to analyze. If not specified, 'src/'
    # will be used.
    srcDir: ''

    # If set to 'true', the action will delete old comments on pull requests
    # before posting new ones. This can help keep the comment section clean.
    deleteOldComments: ''

    # If set to 'true', the action will generate a report comparing the current
    # branch with the target branch. This can be useful for identifying changes
    # introduced in a pull request.
